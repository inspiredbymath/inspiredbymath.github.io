The host, Monty Hall, shows you three closed doors. Behind one door is a brand new car; behind the other two are goats. The rules are simple:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>You pick one door (let&#39;s say, Door #1).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The host, who knows what&#39;s behind each door, opens another door (e.g., Door #3) to reveal a goat.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>He then asks you: &quot;Do you want to stick with your original choice (Door #1) or switch to the other remaining door (Door #2)?&quot;\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>What should you do?

It feels like your choice no longer matters.
